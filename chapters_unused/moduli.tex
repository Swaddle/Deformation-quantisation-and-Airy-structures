\chapter{Deformations and moduli spaces}



%In a more general context we can consider a curve inside the cotangent bundle of a smooth foliated algebraic curve. Let \(X\) be a a complex algebraic curve (two dimensional algebraic variety) with coordinates \( (p,q) \).  The cotangent bundle \(T^*X\) carries a natural symplectic structure. The tautological one form \( \vartheta = p dq\) can be pulled back to \( \Sigma\).
%More generally let \( \sigma \in P\) which is a foliated Poisson surface.
