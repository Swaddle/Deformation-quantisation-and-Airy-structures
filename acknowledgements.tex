First, we would like to thank our supervisor Prof. Paul Norbury, for sharing his knowledge and many valuable insights. 

Also thank you to Dr. Wee Chaimanowong, and Dr. Mehdi Tavakol for many interesting mathematical discussions.

A huge thank you to Grant Kluber, for being a constant source of kindness, support and for listening to our problems. Thank you so much for all the random puzzles and fennecs.

Next, thanks to all my friends, particularly Harry and Alex for the core pandemic memories, helping us get through all the lockdowns with amusing content. Also Alex for all the Patricia coffees, lunch excursions, and general chaos.

Also a shout out to all the Weapon runners: Rocky, Duck, Slash, Popeye, Weapon, and the rest, especially for sharpening up so we could get the marathon and 5km bragging rights over Paul. 

We would also like to thank the University of Melbourne for giving us the opportunity to conduct this research.

Finally, we would like to thank our parents for supporting us throughout the entire journey.
